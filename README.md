# Vehicular-Ad-Hoc-Network-On-Highways
A Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network, or VANET is a technology that uses moving vehicles as nodes in a network to create a mobile network. VANET turns every participating vehicle into a wireless router or node, allowing vehicles approximately 100 meters of each other to connect and, in turn, create a network with a wide range.  As vehicles fall out of the signal range and drop out of the network, other vehicles can join in, connecting vehicles to one another so that a mobile Internet is created. VANET is a subgroup of  MANET where the nodes refer to vehicles. Since the movement of Vehicles are restricted by roads, traffic regulations we can deploy fixed infrastructure at critical locations.
